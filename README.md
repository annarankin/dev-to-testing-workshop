# Testing with Doggos

## Welcome!

This repo contains materials for a quick intro to/overview of testing along with a chance to dive into a "doggy dating" app.

Once you've cloned this repo, try answering the following questions about the application:
- What JavaScript packages in this application do you recognize? Which are unfamiliar?
- What do you think this application does? What is its purpose?
- How is the code structured? Look at the file structure and naming. Is it familiar, unfamiliar? Would you change anything about it?
- Are you able to get it up and running immediately? If so, what are the steps to do so? If not, whatâ€™s preventing you from doing so?
- If you are able to get the app up and running, does it function? Why or why not?
